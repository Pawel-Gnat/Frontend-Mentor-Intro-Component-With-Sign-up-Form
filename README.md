## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:

1. Created consts
2. Created functions that add active class on elements (showError)
3. Created functions that remove active class on elements (clearError)
4. Created "if" functions that checks wheter my inputs are empty (checkError)
5. Created a function that check my email input with a filter (checkEmailError)
6. Created an "if" function that clear my inputs after submitting, if they are correct (checkError)
7. Created a submit button event

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I did this challenge in 7 hours. JavaScript took me 3,5 hours of coding. I improved my JS skills a little, but I'm sure there is a way to code it better. Maybe using some kind of loops? I tried to use .forEach to write less code, but it was too hard for me at this moment. My filter for email input could also be better, I see there are some kind of emails that pass that validations but shouldn't.

I used BEM methodoloy and SCSS for the first time here on Frontend Mentor.
